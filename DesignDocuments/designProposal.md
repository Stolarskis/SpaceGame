# Design Proposal

## Codename: SpaceGame or SpacePirateGame

#### Overview: 
    Set in the distance outreaches of space, in the aftermath
    of a great war between 4 factions where nobody gained any ground. 
    All four factions have entered into an uneasy peace, where each 
    faction controls the space around their main space station.
    Pirates have taken up residence in the no man's land between 
    each faction, preying civilian ships travelling along the newly
    recreated trade routes. 


## Design Phases

#### Phase 1: Base Enviroment and Player Movement
    - Base Enviroment: The base enviroment should consist of a 2d
     plane for the player to run ontop of. As well as a few obsticles
     to run into (asteriods) 

    - *PlayerMovement: The feel/mechanics of the Player Movement is 
       vital toward the rest of the game. 

        - Player movement should be similar to asteroids. Ie, no
         friction, moving fowards causing player to move forwards
         indefinetly. 

        - Player should be able to move backwards.

#### Phase 2: Player Health/Fuel + SpaceStations
    - Player should have the ability to lose health and fuel should
      tick down triggering a restart if either reaches 0.
    - Space stations act as "Shops" to refill on fuel/health.
      Later they will also be for upgrade shops and ship yards.
#### Phase 3: Player Fittings and Station Shops
    - Player should be able to equip their ship with 4 distinct
     weapon types. Lazers, Missiles, Torpedos, Plasma Cannons.
     Each weapon type should only be sold at one of the 4 stations.

        - Lazers: Fast - should come in pulse or beam varities.

        - Missiles: Standard of what you expect as missiles, to
         balance there should be an array of countermeasures chaff
          or emp? Ammo should come in shield or hull varities.
        
        - Torpedos: Similar to missies, but with no tracking 
          and faster than missiles + Higher damage.  Ammo Should
          come in shield or hull varities

        - Plasma Cannons: Slow moving, shotgun type projectiles 
          that do the most damage out of any of the weapon types.
          However, they are slow moving and require lots of manuvering
          to hit.

    - Player Fittings: Player fittings should be as simple as possible.
      Shield Slots, Weapon Slots, Power Slots. Each ship should have a 
      different number of these, with the sizes that are able to fit in 
      these slots be determined by the size of the ships. There should 
      be small, medium, large, and capital ships.

    - Player Shops: Player should be able to upgrade or fit their ships
      in a UI at space stations. Its paramount of the simplicity of these
      UIs. They need to be easy to use and have audio triggers. We want
      the player in and out of these stations as quickly as possible. 
      In just a few clicks or drags.


#### Phase 4: Loot and NPCs (By far the hardest phase)
    - 3 Classes of NPCs:

        - Civilian Ships: Trading or travelling between stations - each
          should belong to the 4 faction of space station

        - Pirate ships, found along trade routes or in the middle of
          the map. Should attack any ship that they come across including
          the player(obv)
        
        - Miliary Ships - 4 types, each patrolling/guarding the space
          station. Should become hostile if you attack them or kill 
          enough of that factions civilian ships.

#### Phase 5: Ships + Station Art (this phase should be being worked on throughout the other phases)
    - Introduce all the ships that will be present in the game. The
      art at this phase doesn't need to be final, but the gameplay of
      the game should be nearing completion at this point.

#### Phase 6: Start Game, Save Game, Game Over
    - Start + Game Over screens.
    - Player... should... be able... to save their progress.
#### Phase 7: Polish
    - UIs: UI most likely needs to be updated by this point.

    - PlayerTesting: Fix any unexpected behavior in ships, or bugs
      that we find through playing the game or having some of our
      friends play the game.
    - Make sure all ship + station art is of the same quality.
